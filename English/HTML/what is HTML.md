## 📝 Summary & Core Concepts

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**, and it is a markup language used to build the basic structure of any web page.  
It is not a programming language, but rather a language for describing and organizing content inside the browser.  

Think of HTML as the **skeleton** of the page, while CSS is the clothing and design, and JavaScript is the movement and interaction.  
Without HTML, the browser cannot understand where the headings, text, images, or links should be placed.  

### 📑 Key Concepts
* **Tag:** An element used to write a part of the page, such as `<p>` for paragraphs.  
* **Attribute:** Additional information inside a tag, such as `href` in links.
